## Installation

To install Glow UI, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Run the following commands to add Glow UI to your project:

```shell
npm install glow-ui-mui @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to help you get started with Glow UI:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { GlowThemeProvider } from 'glow-ui';
import GlowingButton from 'glow-ui/components/GlowingButton';

const themeConfig = {
  primaryColor: '#6366f1',
  secondaryColor: '#8b5cf6',
  fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif',
  glowIntensity: 0.8,
  borderRadius: 8,
};

const App = () => (
  <GlowThemeProvider config={themeConfig}>
    <GlowingButton />
  </GlowThemeProvider>
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Customizing Themes

Glow UI allows for extensive theme customization to fit your brand identity:

- **Primary Color**: The primary accent used throughout the UI.
- **Secondary Color**: A complimentary color for additional accents.
- **Font Family**: Specify the font stack for typography.
- **Glow Intensity**: Adjust the glow effect around elements.
- **Border Radius**: Define the border radius for rounded components.

Modify the `config` object in `GlowThemeProvider` to tailor the design to your needs.

## Components

- **GlowingButton**: A button component with glowing effects.
